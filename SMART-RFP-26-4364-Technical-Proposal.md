## 2. Company Overview and Qualifications

### Company Information
**Legal Entity:** Building Better Communities, LLC
**Lead Consultant:** Maximilian Murphy, Lead ERP Migration Program Manager
**Joint Venture Partner:** Building Better Communities, LLC (DBE-Certified)
**Primary Contact:** [Contact Information]
**Business Address:** [Address]

### Core Philosophy: Human-Centered Design + Quantitative Analysis

At Building Better Communities, LLC, we believe that successful ERP implementations succeed or fail based on how well they serve the people who use them daily. My approach combines Human-Centered Design (HCD) with rigorous quantitative data analysis, differing fundamentally from traditional consulting approaches:

| Traditional Approach | Our HCD + Quantitative Approach |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| "Best Practices" - force-fit business processes to software | "Your Practices" - software configured to your workflows |
| Executive stakeholder interviews only | Shadowing frontline users across all departments |
| Qualitative interviews only | Combined qualitative + quantitative data analysis |
| Requirements lists in spreadsheets | Service blueprints + data-driven metrics |
| Training at the end of project | Co-creation throughout the process |
| 100-page text documents | Visual dashboards, journey maps, and analytics |
| Consultant observes implementation | 3-person team provides hands-on technical leadership |
| Hourly billing with open-ended scope | Firm-fixed pricing based on deliverables |

### Why This Matters for SMART

SMART's mission involves complex, cross-functional operations:
- Bus mechanics requiring mobile inventory access
- Payroll clerks processing unionized workforce timesheets
- Grant managers tracking federal funding requirements
- Finance directors ensuring audit compliance
- Dispatch teams coordinating real-time vehicle operations

A "standardized" ERP system that works perfectly in a corporate office but fails in a maintenance garage is not actually a success—it's a data integrity problem waiting to happen. Our HCD approach ensures the system works for everyone, everywhere, all the time.

## 3. Proposed Approach and Methodology

### 3.1 Comprehensive Needs Assessment

**Phase 2: The "SMART Ethnography" Discovery Model**

SMART's current challenges—manual workarounds, lack of integration between Trapeze and Finance, and aged procurement workflows—are not just software issues; they are workflow and cultural issues.

To ensure the new ERP succeeds where the current system struggles, I propose a **Human-Centered, Ethnographic Discovery Phase** combined with **Quantitative Data Analysis**. Our 3-person team doesn't rely solely on conference room interviews. We deploy qualitative research techniques to uncover the "Shadow ERP"—the hidden spreadsheets, paper notes, and verbal agreements that actually keep SMART running—and quantify their impact with usage analytics, performance metrics, and process mining.

**Timeline: Months 3-6 (16 weeks)**

This intensive timeline is intentional. Real qualitative research takes time. Our Business Analyst needs to catch a "Month-End Close" cycle and a "Grant Reporting" cycle to see the pain points live, not just hear about them secondhand.

#### Our Research Toolkit: Deep-Dive Qualitative Methods

We will employ a "Triangulated Research" approach, combining three data sources to identify Root Causes:

**A. Contextual Inquiry (The "Ride-Along")**

We believe you cannot design for a bus mechanic while sitting in a finance office. Our Business Analyst will conduct "on-the-ground" shadowing sessions:

- **The "Grease-to-Keyboard" Gap:** We will observe Maintenance staff in the garage. *Root Cause Investigation:* Do they delay entering Trapeze data because the terminals are too far away? Is the interface not touch-friendly for gloved hands?
- **The Procurement Trail:** We will physically "follow" a Purchase Requisition from the moment a request is made to the moment the PO is cut. *Root Cause Investigation:* Where does the paper get stuck? Which approver is the bottleneck, and why?
- **The Month-End War Room:** We will sit with Finance during a close period to observe the stress points, identifying exactly which manual Excel reconciliations are consuming the most time.
- **The Dispatch Pulse:** We will ride-along with operations teams to understand dispatch data flow and how driver hours/miles flow from Trapeze OPS to financial reports.

**B. Digital "Frustration Diaries" (Asynchronous Research)**

Interviews often miss the "in-the-moment" pain. We will deploy a lightweight digital survey tool (accessible via mobile) for selected staff to log issues in real-time over a 5-day period.

- *Example Entry:* "Just tried to pull a grant report for the FTA. System crashed twice. Had to export to Excel and manually re-calculate."
- **Value:** This generates a heat map of high-frequency friction points that might be forgotten during a formal interview.

**C. Focus Groups & The "5 Whys" Workshops**

After gathering observational data, we will host cross-functional Focus Groups (e.g., Finance + Maintenance + Grants together).

- **Technique:** We use the "5 Whys" root cause analysis method.
  - *Problem:* Inventory counts in Trapeze don't match the General Ledger.
  - *Why?* Maintenance doesn't enter usage daily.
  - *Why?* The system is too slow.
  - *Why?* It requires a VPN login that times out.
  - *Root Cause:* It's not a lazy worker issue; it's an IT infrastructure/authentication issue.
- **Outcome:** We stop SMART from trying to solve infrastructure problems with "more training."

#### Department-Specific Research Strategy

Our Business Analyst will apply these qualitative techniques to the key functional areas identified in RFP Section 1.03:

| Department | Research Focus | Ethnographic Technique |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Finance (AP/AR/GL)** | The "Manual Bridge" | **Shadowing:** Watch how data is manually moved from ADP/Trapeze into Dynamics GP. Identify the risk of human error. |
| **Maintenance** | The "Physical/Digital Split" | **Contextual Inquiry:** Observe the parts window. How does a physical part leaving the shelf get recorded digitally? |
| **Procurement** | The "Approval Black Hole" | **Process Mapping:** Map the *actual* approval flow vs. the *official* policy. Identify where workflows stall. |
| **Grants** | The "Compliance Burden" | **Artifact Analysis:** Review the actual Excel sheets used to track grants. Why can't the ERP do this? |
| **HR / Payroll** | The "Dual Entry" Risk | **Interview:** Talk to the payroll clerk who likely enters data into ADP and then key-punches it into Finance. |
| **Bus Operations** | The "Data Flow" | **Ride-Along:** Observe dispatch operations and understand how operational data becomes financial data. |

#### From Research to Service Blueprints + Quantitative Metrics

Standard consultants provide a text-based "Requirements Document." Our Business Analyst provides **Service Blueprints** combined with **Quantitative Data Analysis**.

Using the data from ethnographic research, I create visual maps that display:
1. **The User Action:** What the employee is trying to do (e.g., "Receive Goods").
2. **The Front-Stage Touchpoint:** The software screen or form they interact with.
3. **The Back-Stage Process:** What the ERP, Trapeze, and Database are doing in background.
4. **The Pain Points:** Visual "explosion" icons marking where the process breaks and requires a manual workaround.
5. **Quantitative Impact:** Data-driven metrics showing frequency, duration, and cost of each pain point (e.g., "Manual reconciliation occurs 50 times/month, averaging 4 hours each = $X/month in lost productivity").

**Why this leads to Success:**
These blueprints become the "Truth" for the RFP. When I write the RFP, I can say to vendors: *"Here is exactly where our current process fails, backed by data showing it costs SMART $X per month. Show us exactly how your software handles this specific workflow and quantify the expected improvement."*

#### Root Cause Classification

We will categorize every finding in our Needs Assessment Report into three buckets to help SMART prioritize:

- **Type A: Technology Gap.** (The current software simply cannot do X. *Solution: New ERP Feature.*)
- **Type B: Process Gap.** (The software can do it, but SMART's internal policy makes it hard. *Solution: BPR - Business Process Reengineering.*)
- **Type C: User Capability Gap.** (The software is fine, but staff lacks training or hardware. *Solution: Change Management/Training.*)

**Deliverables:**
- Service Blueprints for each major business process
- Comprehensive Needs Assessment Report (by functional area)
- Root Cause Analysis with Type A/B/C classifications
- Digital Frustration Diary heat maps
- As-Is vs. To-Be process documentation
- Technical infrastructure assessment (hardware, software, network, databases)
- Integration requirements matrix for all operational systems
- Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) linking each finding to business impact

### 3.2 ERP RFP Development

**User Stories, Not Technical Requirements**

We translate SMART's needs into actionable vendor requirements using User Story format:

❌ **Traditional Requirement:** "System must interface with Trapeze OPS"

✅ **HCD User Story:** "As a Grant Manager, I need vehicle mileage from Trapeze OPS to automatically populate the National Transit Database (NTD) report fields in the ERP so I don't have to manually copy-paste data between systems, reducing errors and saving approximately 4 hours per monthly report."

**RFP Structure:**
1. Project Overview and Vision
2. Application Requirements (by functional area)
3. Technical Requirements (including infrastructure, security, scalability)
4. Implementation Methodology (must demonstrate user adoption focus)
5. Project Administration (roles, responsibilities, governance)
6. Testing Strategy (including user acceptance testing by frontline staff)
7. Data Conversion Approach
8. Interface Implementation (Trapeze, ADP, Clever Device, Point of Sale)
9. Training Delivery (not just "training provided" but "how will you ensure adoption?")
10. Support and Maintenance

### 3.3 Vendor Evaluation Support

**Structured Evaluation Framework:**

We provide SMART with:
- **Evaluation Criteria Matrix** aligned with weighted scoring (functionality, technical fit, vendor capability, references, price)
- **Staffing Assessment Tools** to evaluate vendor proposed teams
- **Reference Questionnaires** targeting transit and public sector experience
- **Functional Fit Analysis** comparing vendor capabilities against SMART requirements
- **Total Cost of Ownership Analysis** beyond just licensing costs

### 3.4 Contract Negotiation Assistance

**Protection for SMART:**

We ensure contracts include:
- Clear delineation of roles and responsibilities
- Detailed deliverable definitions with acceptance criteria
- Milestone-based payment schedule tied to completed work
- Service level agreements (SLAs) for system performance and support
- Data ownership and exit strategy provisions
- Change order processes with SMART approval authority

### 3.5 Implementation Oversight

**Full-Time Team Engagement:**

Unlike traditional consultants who disappear for months only to reappear with "finished" work, our 3-person team operates with continuous engagement:

- **Bi-weekly progress meetings** with SMART project team
- **Continuous task management** with visible progress tracking
- **Status dashboards** in plain English (not consultant jargon)
- **Risk registers** with mitigation strategies
- **Decision logs** documenting all project decisions
- **24-month continuity** from kickoff through go-live and stabilization

**Design Council Approach:**

We recommend forming a Design Council of actual frontline users (not just managers) who:
- Participate in vendor demos
- Provide input on user interface design
- Test prototypes before implementation
- Serve as champions during rollout
