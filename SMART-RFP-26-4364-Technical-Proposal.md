## 1. Executive Summary

[JV Company Name] respectfully submits this proposal in response to SMART's Request for Proposals for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System Upgrade Consultant. Our Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach to ERP implementation positions us uniquely to deliver a system that empowers SMART's diverse workforce—from bus mechanics using tablets in garages to finance directors in corporate offices.

Unlike large consulting firms that prioritize "best practices" and "standardization" that force organizations to adapt to software, we believe software should adapt to people. This philosophy is particularly critical for SMART, whose mission depends on the seamless collaboration of employees across vastly different roles, environments, and skill levels.

**Our Value Proposition:**
- **15+ years of ERP consulting expertise** with successful migrations of Oracle and Salesforce systems
- **Human-Centered Design methodology** ensuring high user adoption and minimal disruption
- **Firm-fixed pricing** based on deliverables, eliminating budget uncertainty
- **Specialized strike team** providing senior-level attention throughout the project
- **Visual communication style** with service blueprints, journey maps, and plain English documentation

We are prepared to guide SMART through every phase—from comprehensive needs assessment to RFP development, vendor selection, contract negotiation, and implementation oversight—delivering an ERP system that strengthens internal controls, streamlines processes, and serves the people who keep Detroit moving.

## 2. Company Overview and Qualifications

### Company Information
**Legal Entity:** [To be provided - Joint Venture Structure]
**Lead Consultant:** Maximilian Murphy
**Primary Contact:** [Contact Information]
**Business Address:** [Address]

### Core Philosophy: Human-Centered Design for ERP

At [JV Company Name], we believe that successful ERP implementations succeed or fail based on how well they serve the people who use them daily. Our Human-Centered Design (HCD) philosophy differs fundamentally from traditional consulting approaches:

| Traditional Approach | Our HCD Approach |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| "Best Practices" - force-fit business processes to software | "Your Practices" - software configured to your workflows |
| Executive stakeholder interviews only | Shadowing frontline users across all departments |
| Requirements lists in spreadsheets | Service blueprints showing front-stage vs. back-stage interactions |
| Training at the end of project | Co-creation throughout the process |
| 100-page text documents | Visual dashboards, journey maps, and video summaries |
| Hourly billing with open-ended scope | Firm-fixed pricing based on deliverables |

### Why This Matters for SMART

SMART's mission involves complex, cross-functional operations:
- Bus mechanics requiring mobile inventory access
- Payroll clerks processing unionized workforce timesheets
- Grant managers tracking federal funding requirements
- Finance directors ensuring audit compliance
- Dispatch teams coordinating real-time vehicle operations

A "standardized" ERP system that works perfectly in a corporate office but fails in a maintenance garage is not actually a success—it's a data integrity problem waiting to happen. Our HCD approach ensures the system works for everyone, everywhere, all the time.

## 3. Proposed Approach and Methodology

### 3.1 Comprehensive Needs Assessment

**Phase 1: The "SMART Ethnography" Discovery Model**

SMART's current challenges—manual workarounds, lack of integration between Trapeze and Finance, and aged procurement workflows—are not just software issues; they are workflow and cultural issues.

To ensure the new ERP succeeds where the current system struggles, [JV Company Name] proposes a **Human-Centered, Ethnographic Discovery Phase**. We do not rely solely on conference room interviews. We deploy qualitative research techniques to uncover the "Shadow ERP"—the hidden spreadsheets, paper notes, and verbal agreements that actually keep SMART running.

**Timeline: 10-12 weeks**

This intensive timeline is intentional. Real qualitative research takes time. We need to catch a "Month-End Close" cycle and a "Grant Reporting" cycle to see the pain points live, not just hear about them secondhand.

#### Our Research Toolkit: Deep-Dive Qualitative Methods

We will employ a "Triangulated Research" approach, combining three data sources to identify Root Causes:

**A. Contextual Inquiry (The "Ride-Along")**

We believe you cannot design for a bus mechanic while sitting in a finance office. Our consultants will conduct "on-the-ground" shadowing sessions:

- **The "Grease-to-Keyboard" Gap:** We will observe Maintenance staff in the garage. *Root Cause Investigation:* Do they delay entering Trapeze data because the terminals are too far away? Is the interface not touch-friendly for gloved hands?
- **The Procurement Trail:** We will physically "follow" a Purchase Requisition from the moment a request is made to the moment the PO is cut. *Root Cause Investigation:* Where does the paper get stuck? Which approver is the bottleneck, and why?
- **The Month-End War Room:** We will sit with Finance during a close period to observe the stress points, identifying exactly which manual Excel reconciliations are consuming the most time.
- **The Dispatch Pulse:** We will ride-along with operations teams to understand dispatch data flow and how driver hours/miles flow from Trapeze OPS to financial reports.

**B. Digital "Frustration Diaries" (Asynchronous Research)**

Interviews often miss the "in-the-moment" pain. We will deploy a lightweight digital survey tool (accessible via mobile) for selected staff to log issues in real-time over a 5-day period.

- *Example Entry:* "Just tried to pull a grant report for the FTA. System crashed twice. Had to export to Excel and manually re-calculate."
- **Value:** This generates a heat map of high-frequency friction points that might be forgotten during a formal interview.

**C. Focus Groups & The "5 Whys" Workshops**

After gathering observational data, we will host cross-functional Focus Groups (e.g., Finance + Maintenance + Grants together).

- **Technique:** We use the "5 Whys" root cause analysis method.
  - *Problem:* Inventory counts in Trapeze don't match the General Ledger.
  - *Why?* Maintenance doesn't enter usage daily.
  - *Why?* The system is too slow.
  - *Why?* It requires a VPN login that times out.
  - *Root Cause:* It's not a lazy worker issue; it's an IT infrastructure/authentication issue.
- **Outcome:** We stop SMART from trying to solve infrastructure problems with "more training."

#### Department-Specific Research Strategy

We will apply these qualitative techniques to the key functional areas identified in RFP Section 1.03:

| Department | Research Focus | Ethnographic Technique |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Finance (AP/AR/GL)** | The "Manual Bridge" | **Shadowing:** Watch how data is manually moved from ADP/Trapeze into Dynamics GP. Identify the risk of human error. |
| **Maintenance** | The "Physical/Digital Split" | **Contextual Inquiry:** Observe the parts window. How does a physical part leaving the shelf get recorded digitally? |
| **Procurement** | The "Approval Black Hole" | **Process Mapping:** Map the *actual* approval flow vs. the *official* policy. Identify where workflows stall. |
| **Grants** | The "Compliance Burden" | **Artifact Analysis:** Review the actual Excel sheets used to track grants. Why can't the ERP do this? |
| **HR / Payroll** | The "Dual Entry" Risk | **Interview:** Talk to the payroll clerk who likely enters data into ADP and then key-punches it into Finance. |
| **Bus Operations** | The "Data Flow" | **Ride-Along:** Observe dispatch operations and understand how operational data becomes financial data. |

#### From Research to Service Blueprints

Standard consultants provide a text-based "Requirements Document." We provide **Service Blueprints**.

Using the data from our ethnographic research, we will create visual maps that display:
1. **The User Action:** What the employee is trying to do (e.g., "Receive Goods").
2. **The Front-Stage Touchpoint:** The software screen or form they interact with.
3. **The Back-Stage Process:** What the ERP, Trapeze, and Database are doing in the background.
4. **The Pain Points:** Visual "explosion" icons marking where the process breaks and requires a manual workaround.

**Why this leads to Success:**
These blueprints become the "Truth" for the RFP. When we write the RFP, we can say to vendors: *"Here is exactly where our current process fails. Show us exactly how your software handles this specific workflow."*

#### Root Cause Classification

We will categorize every finding in our Needs Assessment Report into three buckets to help SMART prioritize:

- **Type A: Technology Gap.** (The current software simply cannot do x. *Solution: New ERP Feature.*)
- **Type B: Process Gap.** (The software can do it, but SMART's internal policy makes it hard. *Solution: BPR - Business Process Reengineering.*)
- **Type C: User Capability Gap.** (The software is fine, but staff lacks training or hardware. *Solution: Change Management/Training.*)

**Deliverables:**
- Service Blueprints for each major business process
- Comprehensive Needs Assessment Report (by functional area)
- Root Cause Analysis with Type A/B/C classifications
- Digital Frustration Diary heat maps
- As-Is vs. To-Be process documentation
- Technical infrastructure assessment (hardware, software, network, databases)
- Integration requirements matrix for all operational systems
- Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) linking each finding to business impact

### 3.2 ERP RFP Development

**User Stories, Not Technical Requirements**

We translate SMART's needs into actionable vendor requirements using User Story format:

❌ **Traditional Requirement:** "System must interface with Trapeze OPS"

✅ **HCD User Story:** "As a Grant Manager, I need vehicle mileage from Trapeze OPS to automatically populate the National Transit Database (NTD) report fields in the ERP so I don't have to manually copy-paste data between systems, reducing errors and saving approximately 4 hours per monthly report."

**RFP Structure:**
1. Project Overview and Vision
2. Application Requirements (by functional area)
3. Technical Requirements (including infrastructure, security, scalability)
4. Implementation Methodology (must demonstrate user adoption focus)
5. Project Administration (roles, responsibilities, governance)
6. Testing Strategy (including user acceptance testing by frontline staff)
7. Data Conversion Approach
8. Interface Implementation (Trapeze, ADP, Clever Device, Point of Sale)
9. Training Delivery (not just "training provided" but "how will you ensure adoption?")
10. Support and Maintenance

### 3.3 Vendor Evaluation Support

**Structured Evaluation Framework:**

We provide SMART with:
- **Evaluation Criteria Matrix** aligned with weighted scoring (functionality, technical fit, vendor capability, references, price)
- **Staffing Assessment Tools** to evaluate vendor proposed teams
- **Reference Questionnaires** targeting transit and public sector experience
- **Functional Fit Analysis** comparing vendor capabilities against SMART requirements
- **Total Cost of Ownership Analysis** beyond just licensing costs

### 3.4 Contract Negotiation Assistance

**Protection for SMART:**

We ensure contracts include:
- Clear delineation of roles and responsibilities
- Detailed deliverable definitions with acceptance criteria
- Milestone-based payment schedule tied to completed work
- Service level agreements (SLAs) for system performance and support
- Data ownership and exit strategy provisions
- Change order processes with SMART approval authority

### 3.5 Implementation Oversight

**Agile Sprint Approach:**

We don't disappear for months only to reappear with "finished" work. We operate in 2-week sprints with:

- **Bi-weekly progress meetings** with SMART project team
- **Sprint deliverables** showing tangible progress
- **Status dashboards** in plain English (not consultant jargon)
- **Risk registers** with mitigation strategies
- **Decision logs** documenting all project decisions

**Design Council Approach:**

We recommend forming a Design Council of actual frontline users (not just managers) who:
- Participate in vendor demos
- Provide input on user interface design
- Test prototypes before implementation
- Serve as champions during rollout

---

## 7. Implementation Strategy and Deliverables

### 7.1 Project Timeline Overview

**The Strategic Timeline: A 24-Month Roadmap**

We propose a realistic, risk-adjusted schedule that respects public sector constraints and FTA regulations. Competitors often underestimate timelines to appear "fast"—in the public sector, especially with FTA rules, "fast" means "lawsuit."

Our **two-part engagement lifecycle**:
- **Part A: Selection (Months 1-9)** – Fixed Fee
- **Part B: Implementation Oversight (Months 10-24)** – Retainer + Hourly

#### Phase 1: Discovery & Ethnography (Months 1-3)

**Timeline Rationale:** This intensive 10-12 week timeline allows us to observe actual operational cycles, including "Month-End Close" and "Grant Reporting" periods, to capture real pain points—not just reported ones.

**Key Activities:**
- Project kickoff and planning
- Comprehensive ethnographic needs assessment (Contextual Inquiry, Frustration Diaries, 5 Whys Workshops)
- Technical infrastructure assessment
- Service blueprint development
- Root Cause Analysis (Type A/B/C classifications)

**Key Milestone:** The *Comprehensive Needs Assessment Report* (The "Service Blueprints")

#### Phase 2: Strategy & RFP Creation (Months 4-5)

**Best Practice Approach:** We don't just write requirements; we build a **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**. This document links every single RFP requirement back to a specific business pain point found in Phase 1.

**Strategic Move:** We draft the *contracts* during this phase, not just the technical specs. We bake "performance guarantees" into the RFP so vendors know SMART is serious.

**Key Activities:**
- Requirements Traceability Matrix development
- RFP document preparation with User Stories
- Vendor identification and outreach
- RFP distribution and question management

#### Phase 3: The "Show Me" Selection Process (Months 6-8)

**Market Best Practice:** Standard demos are useless. We run **"Scripted Scenarios."**

- **The Test:** We give vendors SMART's *actual* sanitized data (e.g., a messy inventory list from Trapeze). We ask them to ingest and fix it live during the demo.
- **Tenured Move:** We include a "Sandbox Period." Before final selection, the top finalist must give SMART access to a sandbox environment for 2 weeks so the "Design Council" can try to break it.

**Key Activities:**
- Scripted scenario development
- Proposal evaluation support
- Vendor demonstrations with real data scenarios
- Sandbox testing with Design Council
- Reference checks
- Finalist selection

#### Phase 4: Contract Negotiation (Month 9)

**Smart Strategy:** We negotiate the **Statement of Work (SOW)**, not just the price. We ensure the vendor is tied to *milestones* (e.g., "You don't get paid for the 'Design' phase until the Design Council signs off"), rather than just dates.

**Key Activities:**
- Contract review and negotiation
- SOW and milestone definition
- SLA definition
- Change order process establishment
- Data ownership and exit strategy provisions

#### Phase 5: Implementation Oversight - The "Guardian" Model (Months 10-24+)

**The "Guardian" Role:** We shift from "Architects" to "Construction Managers." Most projects fail here because the Consultant leaves, and the Vendor steamrolls the Client. We stay to protect SMART using four pillars:

**A. The "No-Surprise" Governance Structure**
- **Executive Steering Committee (Monthly):** We prepare the "Red/Yellow/Green" dashboard for the CFO/CEO. We interpret "Vendor Speak" into business reality.
- **Core Project Team (Weekly):** We run the "Stand-up" meetings.
- **Risk Management (RAID Log):** We maintain a living log of **R**isks, **A**ssumptions, **I**ssues, and **D**ependencies.
  - *Strategic Check:* If the Vendor says "Integration with ADP is delayed," we flag this immediately as a Critical Path risk and force a mitigation plan before it delays the whole project.

**B. Data Migration: The "Clean House" Strategy**
- **The Trap:** Moving bad data from Dynamics GP to the new ERP (Garbage In, Garbage Out).
- **Our Plan:** We institute a **"Pre-Migration Data Hygiene"** phase.
  - We will force SMART to clean their Vendor Master File (remove duplicates) and Asset Lists *before* the Vendor is allowed to import them.
  - *Tenured Insight:* We will require the Vendor to perform **three** full data loads (Mock 1, Mock 2, Final Production) to ensure accuracy.

**C. Testing: The "Day-in-the-Life" (DITL) Testing**
- **Market Standard:** "Unit Testing" (Does the button work?)
- **Our Standard:** "End-to-End Testing."
  - We simulate a real month at SMART. We start a PO in Maintenance, receive the part, invoice it in AP, pay it in Cash Management, and capitalize it in Fixed Assets.
  - If the flow breaks anywhere, the system fails UAT (User Acceptance Testing).

**D. The Integration "Handshake"**
- **Critical Success Factor:** The Trapeze & ADP integrations.
- We will oversee the **API "Handshake" Testing.** We don't just check if data moves; we check if it moves *correctly* when things go wrong (e.g., what happens if the internet cuts out during a transfer? Does the data duplicate or rollback?)

**Key Activities:**
- Project schedule maintenance
- Governance structure management (Steering Committee, Core Team, RAID Log)
- Data migration hygiene oversight
- Day-in-the-Life testing coordination
- Integration "Handshake" testing
- Progress meeting facilitation
- Status reporting
- Issue resolution
- Go-live support
- Post-implementation stabilization

- **Sprint Review:** Demo of completed work, gather feedback
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Identify improvements for next sprint

This ensures SMART sees continuous progress and can course-correct quickly if needed.
