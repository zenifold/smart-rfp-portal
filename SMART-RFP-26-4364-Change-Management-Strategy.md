# Change Management Strategy
## RFP 26-4364 - ERP System Upgrade Consultant

**Purpose:** This strategy addresses the human side of SMART's ERP transformation, ensuring staff embrace new systems, processes, and workflows rather than resist them.

---

## Executive Summary

ERP projects fail not because of technology. They fail because of people.

Industry statistics are stark:
- **70%** of ERP projects fail to achieve expected benefits due to poor change management
- **40%** of users resist new systems within first 3 months
- **60%** of organizations don't achieve ROI because workarounds persist

My approach is different. I don't just train users. I transform culture through:
- **Corporate Ethnography** - Understanding real workflows before system design
- **Executive Sponsorship** - Visible leadership commitment
- **User Champion Network** - Peer-to-peer support and influence
- **Communication Strategy** - Right messages, right timing, right channels
- **Gradual Adoption** - Pilot, phased rollout, full deployment

This Change Management Strategy details my proven approach to ensure SMART's staff not only accepts but embraces the new ERP system.

## Change Management Framework

### My Model: ADKAR Transition

I use the industry-standard ADKAR framework for change management:

| Element | Definition | My Implementation |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Awareness** | Individuals know why change is happening | Executive communication, department briefings, all-hands kickoff |
| **Desire** | Individuals want to participate and support change | User champion program, early adopter incentives, success stories |
| **Knowledge** | Individuals know how to change | Role-based training, hands-on practice, documentation |
| **Ability** | Individuals can implement required skills and behaviors | Sandbox environment, super-user program, performance support tools |
| **Reinforcement** | Individuals sustain change | Executive reinforcement, recognition programs, ongoing support |

### My Approach: Human-Centered, Data-Driven

Unlike generic change management, my approach is:
- **Human-Centered**: Based on ethnographic understanding of SMART's culture
- **Data-Driven**: Measured through adoption metrics, not assumptions
- **Transit-Informed**: Respects public sector constraints and union environments
- **Implementation Partnership-Supported**: Independent oversight ensures change management actually works

---

- **Skill Gaps**: "I don't know how to use new system"
- **Workflow Disruption**: "This takes longer than my old method"
