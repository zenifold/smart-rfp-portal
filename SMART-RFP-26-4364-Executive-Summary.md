### Transforming SMART's Digital Future Through Human-Centered Design

SMART (Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation) stands at a critical inflection point. Your current ERP landscape—fragmented, manual, and user-resistant—impedes operational efficiency, strains your workforce, and limits your ability to deliver exceptional transit service to the Detroit region. RFP 26-4364 represents not merely a technology upgrade, but an organizational transformation opportunity.

I am Maximilian Murphy, Lead ERP Migration Program Manager, partnering with Building Better Communities, LLC. I bring **15+ years of hands-on ERP migration experience**—not just consulting, but actual implementation of Oracle, Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, and SAP systems. We transform how organizations work through human-centered design, quantitative data analysis, and enterprise data products that serve 500+ users at scale.

## Our Differentiators: Why SMART Should Choose Us

### 1. Corporate Ethnography: Seeing What Traditional Consultants Miss

Most ERP consultants conduct interviews, write requirements documents, and hand off to software vendors. We do something fundamentally different.

**We observe.**

We spend days embedded in SMART's operations—watching dispatchers coordinate routes during rush hour, shadowing maintenance technicians tracking parts in real-time, sitting with finance teams reconciling complex grant expenditures. This ethnographic approach reveals what interviews cannot: "Shadow ERP"—the hidden workarounds, informal processes, and user adaptations that actually keep SMART running.

These aren't problems to solve. They're opportunities to understand how SMART truly functions. We capture these insights through:
- **Contextual Inquiry**: Real-time observation during critical operational moments
- **Digital Frustration Diaries**: Staff document pain points as they occur
- **5 Whys Workshops**: Root cause analysis beyond surface symptoms
- **Service Blueprinting**: Visual maps showing user actions, front-stage touchpoints, back-stage processes, and pain points

The result? Requirements documents that reflect reality, not theory. Implementation plans that respect how SMART actually works. User adoption rates that exceed industry averages because software adapts to people, not people to software.

### 2. Implementation Partner Model: Your Expert Guidance During Vendor Execution

SMART has experienced the pain of ERP projects gone wrong: scope creep, budget overruns, vendor overpromising and underdelivering, deliverables that miss the mark.

Our **Implementation Partner Model** fundamentally changes this dynamic.

Unlike traditional consultants who step away after vendor selection, I remain **with SMART through vendor execution (Months 7-24)**. I don't just observe—I actively guide, test, and protect SMART's interests:

- **Technical Leadership**: Hands-on involvement in configuration, integration, and data migration—not just oversight
- **Scope Protection**: Every vendor-proposed change request undergoes rigorous analysis against SMART's business requirements
- **Quality Assurance**: Independent testing of all deliverables, integration handshakes, and user training effectiveness
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: When vendors push unnecessary features, I push back with quantitative justification

You're not alone. I've been in the trenches of ERP implementations—I know what goes wrong, and I prevent it before it impacts SMART.

This isn't typical consulting where you're handed off to a vendor. I'm your hands-on technical partner from selection through go-live and optimization.

### 3. Firm-Fixed Pricing: Budget Certainty, No Surprises

SMART knows the pain of ERP project budget uncertainty. "Consultant bleed" through hourly billing—hours expanding without corresponding value—has left transit agencies wary.

We eliminate this risk.

**Total Investment: $434,500 (Firm-Fixed Price)**

This isn't an estimate subject to change. It's a commitment. Payment is tied to deliverables, not hours worked. If we encounter challenges or delays, those costs are ours to bear, not SMART's.

Our pricing structure is transparent and deliverable-based:
- **Phase 1: Project Initiation** - $8,000
- **Phase 2: Comprehensive Needs Assessment** - $80,000
- **Phase 3: ERP RFP Development** - $24,000
- **Phase 4: Vendor Evaluation** - $16,000
- **Phase 5: Contract Negotiation** - $8,000
- **Phase 6: Implementation Partnership** - $298,500

No hidden fees. No hourly billing surprises. No scope creep cost overruns. SMART gets exactly what was promised, at exactly the price agreed.

### 4. Transit Industry Expertise: FTA Regulations, NTD Reporting, Public Sector Constraints

I'm not a generic ERP consultant who learned transit yesterday. I understand SMART's unique context from hands-on experience with public transit agencies:

- **Hands-On Transit ERP Experience**: Led Oracle E-Business Suite implementation for 500+ user regional transit authority, reducing manual processes by 70%
- **FTA Grant Compliance**: Every requirement, deliverable, and design decision maps to FTA Circular requirements
- **NTD Reporting**: Designed data structures and workflows to streamline National Transit Database submissions
- **DBE Commitment**: Joint venture with Building Better Communities, LLC demonstrates commitment to diversity and inclusion
- **Public Sector Realities**: I respect budget cycles, procurement rules, stakeholder expectations, and political realities

SMART won't spend hours educating me on transit operations. I speak the language of your operations, finance, and IT teams from Day 1.

## Our Methodology: Four Pillars of Success

### Pillar 1: Service Blueprints Over Requirements Lists

Traditional consultants deliver Excel spreadsheets of functional requirements. We deliver **visual Service Blueprints**—detailed maps showing:
- User actions across the customer journey
- Front-stage touchpoints (what SMART staff and riders see)
- Back-stage processes (systems, data flows, integrations)
- Pain points and failure modes
- Opportunity areas for improvement

These aren't abstract documents. They're actionable blueprints for software design, user training, and process improvement.

### Pillar 2: Data Hygiene First

"Garbage in, garbage out" destroys ERP projects. Vendors promise to clean data during migration. They rarely deliver.

We institute **Pre-Migration Data Hygiene** before the vendor ever touches SMART's systems:
1. **Phase 1 Assessment**: Identify data quality issues across vendor master files, asset lists, employee records, and financial data
2. **Phase 2 Cleansing Rules**: Establish data governance standards (e.g., standardized vendor naming, complete address formats, required fields)
3. **Phase 3 Validation**: Clean data BEFORE vendor import, then validate migration accuracy with three-phase testing

SMART's data will be clean before the ERP system launches. Not after.

### Pillar 3: Integration Handshake Testing

SMART's ERP must integrate with existing systems: Trapeze (transit operations), ADP (HR/payroll), and potentially others.

Most consultants verify: *Does data move between systems?*

We verify: *Does data move correctly when things go wrong?*

Our **Integration Handshake Testing** includes:
- **Positive Path Testing**: Data flows work under normal conditions
- **Negative Path Testing**: What happens when Trapeze is down? When ADP times out? When network latency spikes?
- **Failure Recovery Testing**: Can the system recover gracefully? Is data lost or duplicated?

SMART's integrations won't just work. They'll be bulletproof.

### Pillar 4: Implementation Partnership During Vendor Execution

As detailed above, I remain actively involved as your Implementation Partner throughout vendor execution—configuring modules, writing integrations, cleaning data, training users, and troubleshooting production issues. This isn't oversight; it's hands-on technical leadership.

## Our 24-Month Roadmap: Realistic, Risk-Adjusted, Success-Focused

We've learned from transit ERP projects that failed due to unrealistic timelines—12-month promises that became 24-month nightmares, rushed implementations that failed user acceptance, budgets that collapsed under change orders.

Our **24-month roadmap** is deliberately risk-adjusted:
- **Months 1-4: Discovery & Selection** - Needs assessment, ERP RFP development, vendor evaluation, contract negotiation
- **Months 5-8: Foundation & Integration** - Project charter, integration architecture design, data migration preparation, Implementation Partner setup
- **Months 9-16: Core Implementation** - Module deployment, integration testing, user training, performance tuning
- **Months 17-24: Go-Live & Optimization** - Cutover execution, hypercare support, continuous improvement, knowledge transfer

This timeline respects:
- SMART's budget cycles and fiscal constraints
- FTA grant reporting requirements
- Staff availability and training schedules
- Public sector procurement realities

We don't promise fast. We promise success.

## Why This Proposal Matters for SMART

SMART provides critical transit service to the Detroit region. Your mission—connecting communities, supporting economic opportunity, reducing environmental impact—requires operational excellence.

But your current ERP systems, fragmented and resistant to user adoption, create friction:
- Dispatchers manually re-entering data across systems
- Maintenance technicians frustrated by part tracking processes
- Finance teams struggling with grant reporting and cost allocation
- Executives lacking real-time visibility into operations

This friction wastes time, introduces errors, frustrates staff, and limits SMART's ability to serve your community.

We're not proposing technology for technology's sake. We're proposing transformation through:
- **Software that adapts to people** (not people to software)
- **Processes that respect how SMART actually works** (not how consultants think it should)
- **Budget certainty** (no surprises, no scope creep)
- **Your protection** (Implementation Partner Model against vendor risks)
- **Transit expertise** (FTA compliance, NTD reporting, public sector realities)

## Conclusion: The Right Choice for SMART

SMART has options in this RFP process. Other firms will offer:
- Generic ERP consulting approaches without hands-on implementation experience
- Hourly billing with budget uncertainty and scope creep
- Technology-first designs that ignore user needs
- Standard requirements documents without ethnographic insight
- Hands-off vendor relationships that prioritize vendor interests over SMART's

I offer something fundamentally different:

**A hands-on, quantitatively-driven, human-centered, firm-fixed, transit-experienced partnership that ensures SMART's ERP project succeeds.**

Not just software implementation—15+ years of actual ERP migration experience.

Not just qualitative observations—quantitative data analysis with measurable outcomes.

Not just requirements documents—Service Blueprints based on real ethnographic observation.

Not just vendor oversight—hands-on Implementation Partner from selection through go-live.

Not just another consultant—a Lead ERP Migration Program Manager committed to SMART's success.
