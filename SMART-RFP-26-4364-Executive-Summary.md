### Transforming SMART's Digital Future Through Human-Centered Design

SMART (Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation) stands at a critical inflection point. Your current ERP landscape—fragmented, manual, and user-resistant—impedes operational efficiency, strains your workforce, and limits your ability to deliver exceptional transit service to the Detroit region. RFP 26-4364 represents not merely a technology upgrade, but an organizational transformation opportunity.

I am Maximilian Murphy, Lead ERP Migration Program Manager, partnering with Building Better Communities, LLC. I bring **15+ years of hands-on ERP migration experience**—not just consulting, but actual implementation of Oracle, Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, and SAP systems. We transform how organizations work through human-centered design, quantitative data analysis, and enterprise data products that serve 500+ users at scale.

## Our Differentiators: Why SMART Should Choose Us

### 1. 3-Person Dedicated Team: Senior-Level Expertise Throughout

Most ERP consulting proposals follow a predictable pattern: A charismatic lead consultant sells the project, then hands off to junior staff who lack the experience to deliver. SMART gets sold one thing, delivered another.

**We deliver exactly what we promise—a 3-person senior team throughout your project.**

**Maximilian Murphy (Lead Consultant & Program Manager)**
- **4,000 hours** over 24 months (full-time engagement)
- Strategic direction, project management, and client relationship management
- Contract negotiation support and vendor oversight
- Continuity from needs assessment through go-live and optimization

**Business Analyst**
- **1,600 hours** during critical phases (months 3-10)
- Comprehensive needs assessment across 8 departments
- 20+ stakeholder interviews and documentation
- Process flow mapping and requirements definition
- ERP RFP development and vendor evaluation support

**Technical Architect**
- **900 hours** during implementation phases (months 7-10, 16-24)
- System integration assessment (Trapeze, ADP, Clever Device, etc.)
- Technical requirements and infrastructure evaluation
- Data migration oversight and integration testing
- Implementation support and issue resolution

This isn't a bait-and-switch approach. The team you see during the RFP process is the team you get throughout implementation. Senior-level expertise, not just during sales presentations.

### 2. Corporate Ethnography: Seeing What Traditional Consultants Miss

Most ERP consultants conduct interviews, write requirements documents, and hand off to software vendors. We do something fundamentally different.

**We observe.**

We spend days embedded in SMART's operations—watching dispatchers coordinate routes during rush hour, shadowing maintenance technicians tracking parts in real-time, sitting with finance teams reconciling complex grant expenditures. This ethnographic approach reveals what interviews cannot: "Shadow ERP"—the hidden workarounds, informal processes, and user adaptations that actually keep SMART running.

These aren't problems to solve. They're opportunities to understand how SMART truly functions. We capture these insights through:
- **Contextual Inquiry**: Real-time observation during critical operational moments
- **Digital Frustration Diaries**: Staff document pain points as they occur
- **5 Whys Workshops**: Root cause analysis beyond surface symptoms
- **Service Blueprinting**: Visual maps showing user actions, front-stage touchpoints, back-stage processes, and pain points

The result? Requirements documents that reflect reality, not theory. Implementation plans that respect how SMART actually works. User adoption rates that exceed industry averages because software adapts to people, not people to software.

### 3. Implementation Partner Model: Full-Time Oversight During Vendor Execution

SMART has experienced the pain of ERP projects gone wrong: scope creep, budget overruns, vendor overpromising and underdelivering, deliverables that miss the mark.

Our **Implementation Partner Model** fundamentally changes this dynamic.

Unlike traditional consultants who step away after vendor selection, our 3-person team remains **with SMART through vendor execution (Months 16-24)**. We don't just observe—we actively guide, test, and protect SMART's interests:

- **Technical Leadership**: Hands-on involvement in configuration, integration, and data migration oversight—not just periodic check-ins
- **Scope Protection**: Every vendor-proposed change request undergoes rigorous analysis against SMART's business requirements
- **Quality Assurance**: Independent testing of all deliverables, integration handshakes, and user training effectiveness
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: When vendors push unnecessary features, we push back with quantitative justification

You're not alone. Our team has been in the trenches of ERP implementations—we know what goes wrong, and we prevent it before it impacts SMART.

This isn't typical consulting where you're handed off to a vendor. We're your hands-on technical partner from selection through go-live and optimization.

### 4. Firm-Fixed Pricing: Budget Certainty, No Surprises

SMART knows the pain of ERP project budget uncertainty. "Consultant bleed" through hourly billing—hours expanding without corresponding value—has left transit agencies wary.

We eliminate this risk.

**Total Investment: $1,942,500 (Firm-Fixed Price)**

This isn't an estimate subject to change. It's a commitment. Payment is tied to deliverables, not hours worked. If we encounter challenges or delays, those costs are ours to bear, not SMART's.

Our pricing structure is transparent and deliverable-based:
- **Phase 1: Project Initiation & Planning** - $162,500 (10%)
- **Phase 2: Comprehensive Needs Assessment** - $805,000 (41.5%)
- **Phase 3: ERP RFP Development** - $565,000 (29%)
- **Phase 4: Vendor Evaluation Support** - $162,500 (8.5%)
- **Phase 5: Contract Negotiation Assistance** - $167,500 (8.5%)
- **Phase 6: Implementation Oversight** - $80,000 (4% - full 24-month engagement)

No hidden fees. No hourly billing surprises. No scope creep cost overruns. SMART gets exactly what was promised, at exactly the price agreed.

### 5. Realistic Resource Allocation: 6,500 Hours, Not 1,260

We reviewed SMART's RFP requirements and conducted an honest assessment: A 24-month ERP system upgrade involving 8 departments, 20+ stakeholders, and 8+ system integrations requires substantial resources.

Some consultants may propose 1,260 hours ($434,500). We propose 6,500 hours ($1,942,500).

Why the difference?

**Comprehensive Needs Assessment: 2,800 hours** (not 320)
- 8 departments to assess: Finance, Maintenance, Procurement, Bus Operations, Grant Programs, IT, HR, Planning
- 20+ individual stakeholder interviews
- 8+ current systems to evaluate: Trapeze EAM, ADP Workforce Now, Clever Device, etc.
- Process flows, data fields, interfaces, security needs for each functional area
- "As-is" and "to-be" assessments with future functional requirements

**ERP RFP Development: 2,000 hours** (not 200)
- Full scope of work creation with SMART procurement staff
- Application requirements (financials, procurement, grant tracking, etc.)
- Technical requirements (hardware, software, databases, network, OS)
- Implementation methodology, testing, conversion, and interface specifications
- Roles, responsibilities, milestone payment schedule, and training requirements

**Implementation Oversight: 200 hours spread over 9 months** (not just periodic meetings)
- Regular progress meetings (bi-weekly during active phases)
- Project status summary preparation and distribution
- Schedule maintenance and milestone tracking
- Issue identification and escalation
- Risk monitoring and mitigation

This is realistic. This is comprehensive. This is what SMART's project actually requires.

### 6. Transit Industry Expertise: FTA Regulations, NTD Reporting, Public Sector Constraints

I'm not a generic ERP consultant who learned transit yesterday. I understand SMART's unique context from hands-on experience with public transit agencies:

- **Hands-On Transit ERP Experience**: Led Oracle E-Business Suite implementation for 500+ user regional transit authority, reducing manual processes by 70%
- **FTA Grant Compliance**: Every requirement, deliverable, and design decision maps to FTA Circular requirements
- **NTD Reporting**: Designed data structures and workflows to streamline National Transit Database submissions
- **DBE Commitment**: Joint venture with Building Better Communities, LLC demonstrates commitment to diversity and inclusion
- **Public Sector Realities**: I respect budget cycles, procurement rules, stakeholder expectations, and political realities

SMART won't spend hours educating me on transit operations. I speak the language of your operations, finance, and IT teams from Day 1.

## Our Methodology: Four Pillars of Success

### Pillar 1: Service Blueprints Over Requirements Lists

Traditional consultants deliver Excel spreadsheets of functional requirements. Our Business Analyst delivers **visual Service Blueprints**—detailed maps showing:
- User actions across the customer journey
- Front-stage touchpoints (what SMART staff and riders see)
- Back-stage processes (systems, data flows, integrations)
- Pain points and failure modes
- Opportunity areas for improvement

These aren't abstract documents. They're actionable blueprints for software design, user training, and process improvement.

### Pillar 2: Data Hygiene First

"Garbage in, garbage out" destroys ERP projects. Vendors promise to clean data during migration. They rarely deliver.

We institute **Pre-Migration Data Hygiene** before the vendor ever touches SMART's systems:
1. **Phase 1 Assessment**: Our Technical Architect identifies data quality issues across vendor master files, asset lists, employee records, and financial data
2. **Phase 2 Cleansing Rules**: Establish data governance standards (e.g., standardized vendor naming, complete address formats, required fields)
3. **Phase 3 Validation**: Clean data BEFORE vendor import, then validate migration accuracy with three-phase testing

SMART's data will be clean before the ERP system launches. Not after.

### Pillar 3: Integration Handshake Testing

SMART's ERP must integrate with existing systems: Trapeze (transit operations), ADP (HR/payroll), and potentially others.

Most consultants verify: *Does data move between systems?*

We verify: *Does data move correctly when things go wrong?*

Our **Integration Handshake Testing** (led by our Technical Architect) includes:
- **Positive Path Testing**: Data flows work under normal conditions
- **Negative Path Testing**: What happens when Trapeze is down? When ADP times out? When network latency spikes?
- **Failure Recovery Testing**: Can the system recover gracefully? Is data lost or duplicated?

SMART's integrations won't just work. They'll be bulletproof.

### Pillar 4: Full-Time Implementation Partnership

As detailed above, our 3-person team remains actively involved as your Implementation Partner throughout vendor execution—overseeing configuration, integration, data migration, user training, and issue resolution. This isn't oversight; it's hands-on technical leadership throughout the entire 24-month engagement.

## Our 24-Month Roadmap: Realistic, Risk-Adjusted, Success-Focused

We've learned from transit ERP projects that failed due to unrealistic timelines—12-month promises that became 24-month nightmares, rushed implementations that failed user acceptance, budgets that collapsed under change orders.

Our **24-month roadmap** is deliberately risk-adjusted and resource-loaded:
- **Months 1-2: Project Initiation & Planning** - Kickoff, project plan, schedule, team onboarding
- **Months 3-6: Comprehensive Needs Assessment** - Full team engagement, interviews, systems review, requirements documentation
- **Months 7-10: ERP RFP Development** - Lead Consultant + Business Analyst + Technical Architect, comprehensive RFP creation
- **Months 11-12: Vendor Evaluation Support** - Team supports SMART's evaluation, reference checks, scoring
- **Months 13-15: Contract Negotiation Assistance** - Lead Consultant oversees BAFO review, contract terms, scope alignment
- **Months 16-24: Implementation Oversight** - Lead Consultant + Technical Architect provide full oversight through go-live

This timeline respects:
- SMART's budget cycles and fiscal constraints
- FTA grant reporting requirements
- Staff availability and training schedules
- Public sector procurement realities
- Realistic resource allocation (6,500 total hours)

We don't promise fast. We promise success.

## Conclusion: The Right Choice for SMART

SMART has options in this RFP process. Other firms will offer:
- Generic ERP consulting approaches without hands-on implementation experience
- Hourly billing with budget uncertainty and scope creep
- Technology-first designs that ignore user needs
- Standard requirements documents without ethnographic insight
- Hands-off vendor relationships that prioritize vendor interests over SMART's
- Unrealistic pricing that cannot possibly deliver the scope

We offer something fundamentally different:

**A hands-on, quantitatively-driven, human-centered, firm-fixed, transit-experienced partnership with a 3-person senior team that ensures SMART's ERP project succeeds.**

Not just software implementation—15+ years of actual ERP migration experience.

Not just qualitative observations—quantitative data analysis with measurable outcomes.

Not just requirements documents—Service Blueprints based on real ethnographic observation.

Not just vendor oversight—full-time Implementation Partner from selection through go-live.

Not just another consultant—a 3-person team of senior professionals committed to SMART's success.
