## Form 3.12: Offeror and Subcontractor Certifications

### Program Overview

In accordance with 49 C.F.R. Part 26, and as further set forth in Contract Section 6.27, "Disadvantaged Business Enterprise", as the recipient of federal funds, SMART sets an overall goal annually for DBE participation in contracts financed with federal funds. For professional services, construction, and non-construction contracts awarded during the federal government fiscal year 2019, SMART has proposed an overall DBE goal of 6.8%.

For federally funded contracts, SMART intends to meet the overall DBE goal by setting specific DBE goals on a contract-by-contract basis. Contract goals will be based upon the actual required types of work and the availability of DBEs to perform the required types of work. Therefore, a DBE goal for a particular contract may be more or less than the annual overall DBE goal.

For additional information and to locate certified DBE vendors, please see the Michigan Uniform Certification Program (MUCP): https://www.michigan.gov/mdot/business/contractors/dbe.

### DBE Goal for This Contract

The Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) has set a goal of **zero (0) percent** for participation of Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs) in this contract.

### Application of DBE Goal to Contract Value

The DBE contract goal is applicable to the full contract value, including any contract change orders or amendments. A DBE goal is also applicable during the entire term of the contract, including any extension periods.

### Requirements to Meet DBE Goal

A firm meets a DBE goal by having actual DBE participation equaling or exceeding the percentage of the contract amount specified in the goal established for the solicitation, or by providing backup documentation that good faith efforts have been made to meet the established goal for this contract.

If a proposal is submitted with DBE participation at a lower percentage than the goal set for the contract, then the proposal must include sufficient written documentation of the "good faith efforts" the proposer made to meet the goal. 49 C.F.R. 26.53(c) provides that SMART cannot commit to contracting with a business that has not provided "complete and accurate and [adequate documentation] of the proposer's good faith efforts" to meet a DBE goal. "Good faith efforts" must be made before the Proposal Deadline.

### Definitions of DBEs and SBEs

Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE) and Small Business Enterprises (SBE) are two different types of certifications. A company that qualifies may choose to become certified as both or choose to be certified as just one type of company. Not all SBEs qualify to be a DBE, but all DBEs would qualify as an SBE if they were to seek that certification. Due to DBE certification including the criteria that a socially and economically disadvantaged individual own at least 51% interest and also control management and daily business operations; many small businesses do not qualify for DBE certification.

Offerors can only count work completed by DBE certified firms towards any DBE participation goals set on a SMART contract. Work completed by SBEs cannot be counted towards any contracts with a DBE participation goal. The Prompt Payment clause in this contract applies to both DBE and SBE subcontracted firms. An offeror is required to pay both DBE and SBE subcontractors no later than thirty (30) days from receipt of each payment the prime contractor receives from SMART.

**Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE):** Are for-profit small businesses where socially and economically disadvantaged individuals own at least 51% interest and also control management and daily business operations. For a business to become certified as a DBE, a small business must be owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individual(s). In addition, it must receive DBE certification from one of the certifying agencies who are a member of the Michigan Uniform Certification Program (MUCP). Only companies certified as a DBE by an agency within the State of Michigan can be counted towards a SMART contract's DBE participation percentage goal.

**Small Business Enterprises (SBE):** Are businesses that have been certified by a local and/or state government entity that have met the Small Business Administration's (SBA) thresholds for being a small business. A business qualification is determined by the company's average gross receipts or by the number of employees.

**Note:** To count towards the stated DBE goal, a firm must be certified as a DBE in the Michigan Unified Certification Program (MUCP). Firms certified as only a Small Business Enterprise (SBE) cannot be counted towards DBE participation.

### Certified Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Certification

Indicate if your company or any of the subcontractor(s) that will be working on this contract are a certified Small Business Enterprise (SBE).

### Payment

As set forth in Contract Sections 6.27 "Disadvantaged Business Enterprise" and 4.08 "Payment and Retainage", Contractor must ensure prompt payment for work completed by Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.

The prime contractor shall pay each DBE/SBE subcontractor under this contract for satisfactory performance of the subcontractor's portion of the contract no later than thirty (30) days from receipt of each payment the prime contractor receives from SMART. The prime contractor shall return any retainage withheld to ensure satisfactory completion of the work to each subcontractor within thirty (30) days after the DBE/SBE subcontractor achieves the specified work as verified by SMART's Project Manager. Any disputes that arise regarding the satisfactory completion of work by a DBE/SBE subcontractor shall be brought to the attention of SMART's Project Manager, who will determine if the work is satisfactory.

Any delay of payment from the above referenced time frame may occur only for good cause following written approval from SMART's Project Manager. The failure by the prime contractor to carry out the requirements of this section, without just cause, is a material breach of this contract, which may result in SMART withholding payment from the prime contractor until all delinquent payments have been made to the DBE/SBE subcontractor.

It is the responsibility of the Prime Contractor to provide SMART's DBE Compliance Coordinator with copies of invoices received by the offeror's DBE/SBE subcontractor(s), along with proof of payment.
