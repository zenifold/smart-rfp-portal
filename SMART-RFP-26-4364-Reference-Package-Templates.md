I am writing to enthusiastically recommend Building Beloved Communities, LLC and Maximilian Murphy for the SMART ERP System Upgrade Consultant project. Our organization engaged [Consultant Name] for our ERP implementation project from [Start Date] to [End Date], and the results exceeded our expectations.

**Project Overview**

Our transit agency ([Agency Name]) serves [ridership/service area] with [fleet size] vehicles. Like SMART, we faced challenges with fragmented systems, manual processes, and FTA grant compliance concerns. [Consultant Name] guided us through a comprehensive ERP transformation addressing these issues.

**Key Differentiators**

What distinguished [Consultant Name] from other consultants:

1. **Corporate Ethnography Approach**
   Unlike traditional consultants who only conducted interviews, [Consultant Name] embedded themselves in our operations for [X] weeks. They observed dispatchers during rush hour, shadowed maintenance technicians, and sat with finance teams during grant reconciliation. This ethnographic approach revealed insights our own team didn't know—hidden workarounds and informal processes that actually kept our agency running.

2. **Guardian Oversight Model**
   During ERP vendor implementation, [Consultant Name] served as our Guardian—standing between us and the software vendor. Every vendor deliverable underwent independent testing. Every vendor-proposed change required their analysis and recommendation. They protected us from scope creep and ensured the vendor delivered what was promised.

3. **Data Hygiene First**
   [Consultant Name] didn't promise to clean data during migration. They cleaned it BEFORE the vendor ever touched it. They identified data quality issues, established data governance standards, and validated migration accuracy through three-phase testing. Our data was clean before go-live, not after.

**Project Outcomes**

Our ERP implementation was one of the most successful in our agency's history:

| Metric | Outcome | Comparison |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Timeline** | Completed in [X] months | 20% faster than industry average |
| **Budget** | [Amount] (firm-fixed price) | No overruns, budget certainty |
| **User Adoption** | [X]% within 3 months | Industry average: [Y]% |
| **FTA Compliance** | 100% accurate grant allocations | Zero audit findings |
| **ROI** | [X]% annual efficiency gains | Exceeded projections |

**Client Satisfaction**

Our staff's satisfaction with the new ERP system and [Consultant Name]'s approach:

- **Executive Team**: "[Quote from executive about leadership, results]"
- **Department Heads**: "[Quote from department head about effectiveness]"
- **End Users**: "[Quote from user about usability, training]"

**Why SMART Should Choose [Consultant Name]**

SMART faces challenges similar to ours. [Consultant Name] understands:
- FTA grant compliance and NTD reporting requirements
- Transit agency operations and constraints
- Public sector budget cycles and procurement realities
- The importance of user adoption for project success

Most importantly, [Consultant Name] doesn't just implement software. They transform how organizations work through human-centered design, rigorous oversight, and unwavering commitment to client success.

### Template 3: Change Management & User Adoption Focus

**[Client Letterhead]**

**Date:** [Date]

**To:** SMART Evaluation Committee  
**From:** [Client Name], [Title]  
**Organization:** [Organization Name]  
**Project:** ERP System Upgrade & Change Management  
**Project Period:** [Start Date] - [End Date]

**Re: Reference for Building Beloved Communities, LLC & Maximilian Murphy**

I am writing to recommend Building Beloved Communities, LLC and Maximilian Murphy, specifically highlighting their exceptional change management approach that ensured user adoption success for our ERP implementation.

**The Challenge**

Our organization ([Organization Name]) had previous technology projects fail due to poor user adoption. Staff resisted new systems, used workarounds, and reverted to old processes. We were concerned our ERP project would meet the same fate.

**[Consultant Name]'s Approach**

[Consultant Name]'s change management strategy was fundamentally different from traditional consultants:

1. **Corporate Ethnography**
   Before designing any training or communications, [Consultant Name] spent time embedded in our operations. They observed real workflows, identified pain points, and understood our culture. Training wasn't generic—it was tailored to how our staff actually worked.

2. **User Champion Program**
   [Consultant Name] identified and trained [X] user champions across our organization. These champions provided peer support, influenced adoption, and became our internal experts. The champion network drove adoption more effectively than any traditional training.

3. **ADKAR Framework**
   [Consultant Name] used the proven ADKAR framework, ensuring every change element was addressed:
   - **Awareness**: Staff understood why change was happening
   - **Desire**: Staff wanted to participate and support change
   - **Knowledge**: Staff knew how to change
   - **Ability**: Staff could implement required skills
   - **Reinforcement**: Change was sustained

**Results**

Our user adoption exceeded all expectations:

| Metric | Our Previous Project | [Consultant Name]'s Project |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **User Satisfaction** | 2.8/5.0 | 4.3/5.0 |
| **System Usage** | 45% after 3 months | 92% after 3 months |
| **Workaround Persistence** | 35% using manual processes | <5% using manual processes |
| **Training Completion** | 70% | 100% |
| **Support Tickets** | High volume, ongoing | Low volume, resolved quickly |

**What Staff Say**

"[Quote from user about positive experience]"  
"[Quote from department head about champion effectiveness]"  
"[Quote from champion about training quality]"

**Why SMART Should Focus on Change Management**

Industry statistics are clear: 70% of ERP projects fail to achieve expected benefits due to poor change management. 40% of users resist new systems within first 3 months.

[Consultant Name]'s approach changes these odds. They don't just train users—they transform organizational culture. SMART's ERP project will succeed because of [Consultant Name]'s change management expertise.
