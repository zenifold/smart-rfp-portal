## Pricing Methodology and Rationale

### Firm-Fixed Pricing Benefits

**Why Fixed Pricing Protects SMART:**

1. **Budget Certainty:** SMART knows the exact cost before the project begins
2. **No Surprise Invoices:** Hourly billing can lead to scope creep and cost overruns; fixed pricing eliminates this risk
3. **Incentive Alignment:** We are incentivized to work efficiently because we absorb any inefficiency costs
4. **Transparency:** All costs are disclosed upfront with clear deliverable definitions
5. **Risk Protection:** If requirements change, change orders with SMART approval are required, preventing unauthorized scope expansion

### Change Order Process

**Scope Change Control Board:**

Any requests for additional work beyond the defined scope will be addressed through a formal Change Order process:

1. SMART submits change request in writing
2. We assess impact on timeline and pricing
3. Change order document prepared with revised scope, timeline, and cost
4. SMART review and approval required before work begins
5. Approved change order becomes part of contract

**This process ensures SMART maintains control over scope and budget while allowing for legitimate project needs.**

### Hourly Rate Breakdown

Our blended hourly rate of $275 reflects:
- **Project Management and Strategic Direction:** $275/hour
- **Business Analysis and Requirements Gathering:** $225/hour
- **Human-Centered Design and User Research:** $200/hour
- **Technical Infrastructure Assessment:** $350/hour

These rates are competitive with mid-market consulting firms while providing senior-level expertise that larger firms typically reserve for partners.

### Value Proposition

**Compared to Large Consulting Firms:**

| Factor | Large Firm Approach | Our Approach |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| Pricing | Hourly billing with open-ended scope | Firm-fixed pricing by deliverable |
| Team | Partners for sales, juniors for execution | The team you see is the team you get |
| Communication | 100-page text documents | Visual dashboards and plain English |
| Methodology | Best practices standardization | Human-Centered Design customized to SMART |
| Budget Risk | High - scope creep common | Low - change order control protects SMART |
| Timeline Visibility | Quarterly or monthly reports | Bi-weekly sprints with visible progress |

**Total Cost of Ownership Consideration:**

While our price may be higher than the lowest bidder, our approach minimizes total cost through:
- High user adoption reducing training and rework costs
- Early requirement identification preventing expensive changes during implementation
- Strong contract negotiation protecting SMART from vendor overages
- Agile oversight ensuring issues are addressed before they become costly problems

## Additional Pricing Notes

### Contingency Allocation

The 100-hour contingency (approximately $27,500) is included to accommodate:
- Unexpected complexities during needs assessment
- Additional stakeholder interviews if required
- Unforeseen integration challenges
- Additional vendor evaluation activities
- Extended implementation oversight if needed

This contingency demonstrates our commitment to project success without requiring SMART to approve numerous small change orders.

### Implementation Oversight Flexibility

The 400 hours allocated for implementation oversight (approximately $110,000) is based on a typical 12-18 month implementation timeline. If SMART's selected ERP vendor requires shorter or longer oversight periods, the hours can be adjusted through mutual agreement, with pricing adjusted proportionally.

### Competitive Positioning

Our total price of $434,500 represents:
- **Approximately $36,000 per month** for an 18-month engagement
- **Significant cost savings** compared to large consulting firms that typically bill $350-450/hour with partner premiums
- **Senior-level expertise** throughout, not just during sales presentations
- **Value-added deliverables** including service blueprints, user stories, and visual documentation
- **Reduced risk** through firm-fixed pricing and change order controls

### Price Negotiation Flexibility

While we believe our pricing reflects fair value for the expertise and methodology we provide, we are open to discussing:
- Phased engagement (starting with needs assessment, then proceeding based on findings)
- Adjusted scope based on SMART's priorities
- Alternative team composition if certain phases have different resource requirements

We are not open to converting firm-fixed pricing to hourly billing, as this would undermine the budget certainty benefits our approach provides SMART.
