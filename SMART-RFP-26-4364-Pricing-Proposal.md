### Comparison to Market Pricing

| Pricing Category | Typical Market Rate | Our Price | Position |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Large Consulting Firm** | $2.5M - $3.5M | $1.94M | 30-45% savings |
| **Mid-Market Firm** | $1.8M - $2.5M | $1.94M | Competitive |
| **Boutique Firm** | $1.2M - $2.0M | $1.94M | Premium with value |

**Why We're Competitive:**
- Lower overhead than large firms (no partner premiums, no junior staff markups)
- Senior-level expertise throughout (not just during sales)
- Efficient methodology (Human-Centered Design reduces rework)
- No scope creep risk (firm-fixed pricing with change order controls)

### Firm-Fixed Pricing Benefits

**Why Fixed Pricing Protects SMART:**

1. **Budget Certainty:** SMART knows the exact cost before project begins
2. **No Surprise Invoices:** Hourly billing can lead to scope creep and cost overruns; fixed pricing eliminates this risk
3. **Incentive Alignment:** We are incentivized to work efficiently because we absorb any inefficiency costs
4. **Transparency:** All costs are disclosed upfront with clear deliverable definitions
5. **Risk Protection:** If requirements change, change orders with SMART approval are required, preventing unauthorized scope expansion

### Change Order Process

**Scope Change Control Board:**

Any requests for additional work beyond defined scope will be addressed through a formal Change Order process:

1. SMART submits change request in writing
2. We assess impact on timeline and pricing
3. Change order document prepared with revised scope, timeline, and cost
4. SMART review and approval required before work begins
5. Approved change order becomes part of contract

**This process ensures SMART maintains control over scope and budget while allowing for legitimate project needs.**

### Value Proposition

**Compared to Large Consulting Firms:**

| Factor | Large Firm Approach | Our Approach |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| Pricing | Hourly billing with open-ended scope | Firm-fixed pricing by deliverable |
| Team | Partners for sales, juniors for execution | The team you see is the team you get |
| Communication | 100-page text documents | Visual dashboards and plain English |
| Methodology | Best practices standardization | Human-Centered Design customized to SMART |
| Budget Risk | High - scope creep common | Low - change order control protects SMART |
| Timeline Visibility | Quarterly or monthly reports | Regular progress meetings with visible status |
| Implementation Oversight | Periodic check-ins | Full-time oversight during critical phases |

**Total Cost of Ownership Consideration:**

While our price may be higher than lowest bidder, our approach minimizes total cost through:
- High user adoption reducing training and rework costs
- Early requirement identification preventing expensive changes during implementation
- Strong contract negotiation protecting SMART from vendor overages
- Multi-disciplinary team addressing issues before they become costly problems
- Full implementation oversight reducing risk of project failure

## Additional Pricing Notes

### Resource Flexibility

Our 3-person team structure provides flexibility to meet SMART's evolving needs:

**Business Analyst** can be deployed intensively during needs assessment (months 3-6) when stakeholder interviews, process mapping, and requirements definition are critical, then scaled back as we transition to RFP development and vendor evaluation.

**Technical Architect** ramps up during RFP development (months 7-10) to define technical requirements and integration needs, then provides active oversight during implementation (months 16-24) to ensure technical execution meets specifications.

**Lead Consultant** maintains full-time engagement throughout to provide continuity, strategic direction, and ensure project success.

### Implementation Partnership Scope

The 200 hours allocated for implementation oversight (approximately $80,000 over 9 months) covers:
- Regular progress meetings (bi-weekly during active phases)
- Project status summary preparation and distribution
- Schedule maintenance and milestone tracking
- Issue identification and escalation
- Risk monitoring and mitigation
- SMART relationship management and communication

This is **not** hands-on configuration or data migration execution (those responsibilities belong to SMART's selected ERP vendor), but rather oversight to ensure the vendor delivers on commitments and meets SMART's requirements.

### Competitive Positioning

Our total price of $1,942,500 represents:
- **Approximately $81,000 per month** for a 24-month engagement
- **Significant cost savings** compared to large consulting firms that typically bill $350-450/hour with partner premiums
- **Senior-level expertise** throughout, not just during sales presentations
- **Value-added deliverables** including service blueprints, user stories, and visual documentation
- **Reduced risk** through firm-fixed pricing and change order controls
- **Full implementation oversight** ensuring project success

### Price Negotiation Flexibility

While we believe this pricing reflects fair value for the expertise and methodology we provide, we are open to discussing:
- Phased engagement (starting with needs assessment, then proceeding based on findings)
- Adjusted scope based on SMART's priorities
- Alternative team composition if certain phases have different resource requirements

We are not open to converting firm-fixed pricing to hourly billing, as this would undermine the budget certainty benefits our approach provides SMART.
